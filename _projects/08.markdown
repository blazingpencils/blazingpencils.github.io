Winning design for General Electric Water and Process Technologies Group's innovation challenge. 

My mistake-proof design incorporated identical ends, with male and female couplers at both ends. The application is for industrial water filter cartridges, that can filter large volumes of dirty water for drinking. The design took injection molding details into consideration, creating a low-cost solution without expensive injection molding requirements. Delivered in Solidworks.
