####Winnebago Licensing Study
Concept sketches to enable my client to win a license to produce and market Winnebago branded camping gear and outdoor experience gear. 

####Our proposal included a multipurpose trailer that could convert to a utility/boat n bike trailer, a folding rowboat with clear 'glass floor, camp chairs, table and cooking/tailgating equipment. Collaboration with Styleworks Creative, headed by Tom Froberg and Alaina Caldwell.
